# Terminal Odyssey
Terminal odyssey is a simple terminal- and chat based adventure. You're working at a terminal when you suddenly get a message. Somehow someone who's venturing into an old lost spaceship, which is floating in outer-space, has found a way to get in contact with you. You will have to help him in his endeavours, as you are his only remaining connection to earth.

### Terminal
During a big part of this adventure you will be using the terminal. The terminal will have full-fletched working commands with which you will have to connect to other devices, look for clues in files and most of all take control of devices around the old spaceship.

### Chat
Another big part of this adventure is keeping up with the person in the old spaceship. He will ask you questions which you will have to answer, or will give you hints with which you can progress using the terminal.
